# Name of the Project
 Simple Shell Project

## Description

This project is a simple shell implementation, also known as a command-line interpreter. It provides a basic command-line interface where users can interact with the operating system by executing various commands and programs.

## Features

- Command execution: The shell allows users to execute commands and run programs by typing them into the command prompt.
- Input/output redirection: Users can redirect input and output streams, enabling them to read input from files or write output to files.
- Pipeline support: Users can create command pipelines by connecting multiple commands together, allowing the output of one command to serve as input to another.
- Built-in commands: The shell provides a set of built-in commands that can be executed directly, such as `cd` for changing directories or `exit` for terminating the shell.
- Error handling: The shell handles errors gracefully, providing appropriate error messages and returning exit codes.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language: The shell is implemented using the C programming language, taking advantage of its low-level system access and standard libraries.
- Operating system interfaces: The shell utilizes operating system interfaces, such as system calls, to interact with the underlying operating system and execute commands.
